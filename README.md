** Instance Variables ** :
-> frame: A JFrame object representing the main window of the calculator application.
-> textfield: A JTextField object used to display input numbers and calculation results.
-> myfont: A Font object specifying the font style and size for text displayed in the text field.
-> numberbuttons[]: An array of JButton objects representing number buttons labeled with digits 0-9.
-> funcbuttons[]: An array of JButton objects representing function buttons for arithmetic operations and control actions.
-> addbutton, subbutton, mulbutton, divbutton, expbutton, decbutton, delbutton, eqlbutton, clrbutton, negbutton, modbutton: Individual JButton objects representing arithmetic and control operations.
-> num1, num2, result: Double variables used to store operands and results of arithmetic operations.
-> label: A JLabel object displaying the title "Simple Calculator with JAVA".
-> panel1, panel2: JPanel objects used to organize and layout the number and function buttons within the calculator interface.
** Constructor **:
-> The constructor of the Calculator class initializes the graphical user interface (GUI) components required for the calculator application.
-> It sets up the main frame with a specified title and size, configures the layout, and adds essential components such as the text field, buttons for numbers and arithmetic operations, as well as panels to organize the layout.
-> Additionally, it assigns action listeners to the buttons to handle user input and perform corresponding actions.
-> The constructor ensures that the calculator interface is visually appealing and functional, ready to be displayed to the user upon instantiation.
-> Through its concise implementation, it demonstrates the efficient setup of GUI components for creating interactive app
** Methods ** :
-> main(String[] args): This method serves as the entry point for the calculator application.
   It initializes an instance of the Calculator class, triggering the initialization of the graphical user interface (GUI) components and starting the application.
   Users can launch the calculator by executing this method.
-> actionPerformed(ActionEvent e): This method is responsible for handling button click events in the calculator interface.
   It is invoked whenever a button is clicked, and it determines the action to be taken based on the button's functionality.
   For example, when a number button is clicked, it appends the corresponding digit to the input field. Similarly, when an arithmetic operation button is clicked, it performs the 
   corresponding arithmetic operation on the entered numbers and displays the result.
   This method ensures the interactive behavior of the calculator interface.
** Dependencies **:
